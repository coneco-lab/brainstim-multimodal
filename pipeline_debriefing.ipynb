    "In the context of TMS-EEG:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The _signal_ is the fraction of scalp voltage generated by the cerebral cortex in response to TMS pulses\n",
    "- The _noise_ is the fraction of scalp voltage generated by any non-cerebral source, including (but not limited to) muscles, eyes, and electronic instrumentation (chiefly the TMS coil itself)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is usually a complex process that includes multiple sequential transformations of the TMS-EEG data.\n",

    "Such sequence of transformations is a _**preprocessing pipeline**_."

    "\n",
    "We are interested in high-pass filtering the data to discard all frequencies below 0.1 Hz, preserving others. Oscillations at very low frequencies (so-called _slow drifts_) are usually due to slow-cycling local currents that are generated at the scalp by processes like sweating or the exchange of ions between the electrode and the electrode gel, so they are not interested for scientific purposes.\n",
