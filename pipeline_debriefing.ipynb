The aim of this activity is to introduce the main steps of a typical TMS-EEG preprocessing pipeline, explaining their conceptual background alongside their Python implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used throughout the notebook come from one condition and one subject of [Zazio et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245721006714).

    "The preprocessing pipeline implemented in this notebook is loosely inspired by the one described in Zazio et al. (2021) under section \"_2.3.1. TMS-EEG preprocessing_\". The original pipeline has been largely preserved for consistency, but also adapted to the constraints of a short hands-on educational activity. The most relevant modification is the omission of the [SOUND](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811917308480) and [SSP-SIR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811916301495) algorithms, which could not be treated with clarity in the time at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has no pretense of endorsing one particular pipeline as the most effective or most elegant. The aim is 100% educational and the target audience are absolute beginners. Therefore, the preprocessing steps included in the pipeline are merely the most common, which cannot be ignored by an introductory presentation."

While it might seem trivial, computational reproducibility is a known issue in science and technology: to give a rough sense of its relevance, searching it on Google Scholar returns [more than one million results](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=it&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=computational+reproducibility&btnG=) as of late 2025.  \n",

    "Computational reproducibility is influenced by a myriad factors, and determining the exact causes behind a reproducibility failure can be very difficult &mdash; especially in the absence of detailed information about all the software and hardware involved in and around a given process. However, close adherence to a few good practices can increase the reproducibility of any process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ICA, the good practices for computational reproducibility are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set a random seed\n",
    "- Ensure that the fitting process stops upon reaching a true solution. To this end, it is useful to:\n",
    "    - Increase the maximum number of iterations, to make sure that the fitting does not stop too early (and therefore, too distant from a true solution)\n",
    "    - Decrease the tolerance parameter. The tolerance parameter is a threshold for change between unmixing matrices: when the difference between two unmixing matrices from two consecutive attempts is less than the tolerance parameter, the fitting can be considered concluded because the fact that changes are getting very small suggests that the true solution is very close\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, ICA fitting cannot go on forever, so one might be forced to make less iterations and/or keep the tolerance parameter to a relatively high value. In these cases like in all others, it is very important to document which values were used for the parameters, so readers of your work can relate your output to the context that generated it. \n",

    "Manual artifact rejection (MAR) is the act of visually inspecting EEG data and flagging epochs for rejection with a mouse click. Afer researchers have inspected the whole dataset, flagged epochs are discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "MAR is the simplest form of data cleaning, as it merely thrashes unusable data. It has mainly three use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove the largest artifacts before feeding the data to automatic procedures like ICA\n",
    "    - This can increase the effectiveness of automatic procedures, for example yielding clearer ICA decompositions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove leftover artifacts after automatic procedures\n",
    "    - For example, one may remove ocular artifacts by rejecting ICA's ocular components, but that will not remove the artifacts due to occasional muscle contractions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove the most obvious artifacts, and do no more\n",
    "    - This is what purists do: no automatic procedures, only MAR (plus some filtering and bad channels rejection at most)\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases, the criteria to follow for MAR are usually the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data are characterised by artifacts that present as high-frequency, high-amplitude fluctuations that cannot plausibly be cerebral\n",
    "- The artifacts in question are circumscribed in time\n",
    "- The artifacts in question affect multiple channels\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of epochs that can be rejected depends on the amount of epochs at hand: MAR must hit a trade-off between cleaning the data as much as possible and preserving as many epochs as possible to avoid losing statistical power. There is no universally valid number, but as a rule of thumb it would be better to keep at least 100 epochs per condition. This goal is usually easy to reach, as the number of epochs that are worth rejecting manually are usually around ten (although that depends a lot on the quality of the data)."
