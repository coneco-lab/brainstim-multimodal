    "We are interested in high-pass filtering the data to discard all frequencies below 0.1 Hz, preserving others. Oscillations at very low frequencies (so-called _slow drifts_) are usually due to slow-cycling local currents that are generated at the scalp by processes like sweating or the exchange of ions between the electrode and the electrode gel, so they are not interested for scientific purposes.\n",
